		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p class="lead-in">Open Missouri takes the privacy of you -- our site visitors and community members -- seriously. Please read this policy closely so you understand our practices. If you have any questions, please address them to privacy@openmissouri.org. Our goal is to sustain a vibrant Open Missouri community while protecting your privacy. This policy may be updated from time to time, so we encourage you to visit this page often and become familiar with any changes.</p>
		<p>Your use of Open Missouri or provision of any personal information to it constitutes an agreement to these terms and any later changes. Do not use the site or provide your personal information if disagree at all.</p>

		<h3>Personal information of community members</h3>
		<p>If you want to take full advantage of Open Missouri's features, you need to become a community member and create a personal profile with detailed information about yourself when you sign up. We will not sell, rent or otherwise share this personally identifying information about you without your consent.</p>
		
		<h3>Some actions are public by nature</h3>
		<p>Some the actions you take on the site are public by nature. For instance, anytime you comment, that is visible to all. If you use the social-media tools on the site, that information will be shared on that particular social-media site. In addition, your use of the social-media tools may be noted on the Open Missouri activity stream, which the public can view.</p>
		<p>Other site actions by community members will be noted in the Open Missouri activity stream, including adding a data set to the catalog, creating an account and generating a Sunshine Law request. You must set your profile to opt out for each of these items individually if you do not wish to share this information in the activity stream.</p>

		<h3>Email from Open Missouri</h3>
		<p>We require community members to provide their e-mail addresses when they establish their accounts. Occasionally, we will contact you at this to inform you about site changes or other matters of interest to the Open Missouri community. You can opt out of these emails. However, we plan to keep the messages to a minimum.</p>
		<p>Site users have the option of subscribing to Open Missouri updates. We will use those addresses to send out regular email messages about the site. Again, we will not sell, rent or otherwise share this personally identifying information without your consent.</p>

		<h3>Information Open Missouri automatically generates about you and analyzes</h3>
		<p>Open Missouri keeps a record of actions you take on the site, such as the pages you visit and the information you enter into forms. Even if you are not logged into the site as a community member, we record: URL visited, browser type and IP address. Websites commonly collect this type of information. We will use Google Analytics (or other analytics tools) to examine this information, looking at overall behavior on the site and user demographics. We will not use the information to study individual users, unless we have their permission.</p>

		<h3>Dealing with the authorities</h3>
		<p>Open Missouri will only disclose information in response to warrants, subpoenas or other valid legal processes, as we need to abide by the law.</p>

		<h3>Transfer of information</h3>
		<p>In the event that Open Missouri is transferred to another organization, all website content will also be transferred.</p>

		<h3>Children under 13</h3>
		<p>Open Missouri is intended for adults. We will not knowingly allow children under age 13 to join the Open Missouri user community and enter personal information. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under age 13 whom you believe has submitted personal information to Open Missouri, please contact us immediately.</p>

		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>Open Missouri does not place cookies on your computer. We do use cookies on our server that allow your browser to remain logged into the site, if you choose.</p>
		
		<h3>Outside links and sites</h3>
		<p>Open Missouri contains links that are not owned or controlled by Open Missouri. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of these sites. Please read the privacy statements of every site that collects personal information.</p>
